# XML_file_downloader

This is currently very broken, my code is here mostly just for backup. 

The code I need to fix is in lib/filegrabber.rb 

I can't figure out how the h*ll to use Capybara/chrome to download stuff, because whatever approach I try breaks... 

- Installing capybara and poltergeist works, trying to use :chrome with capybara is a dog's breakfast. 

It looks like the config is all playing nice, except that the @session.visit "url" doesn't work - 'method not found' !?!?

I am tired, will try again later.
